### About the game
Based on the popular game 2048 but on a simple interface. The player can slide the tiles in four directions: up, down, left and right. In each slide, if there are two adjacent non-empty tiles with the same value, they will merge together and form a new tile with the value that is the sum of the original two.
After each slide, a new tile with the value 2 or 4 is placed in one of the remaining empty tiles
The player win if one of the tiles has the value 2048 or lose if the grid is full of non-empty tiles.
